================================================= 21:00 - 31/7 ================================================= 
- Today, I wrote a class called MyStepper. 
- I need to add: limit switch, emergency switch, mechanism to handle emergency pressed or limit switch pressed (I think I sould reset the parameters when there is an emergency)
- I need to add homing.
- I need to reorganise the library
